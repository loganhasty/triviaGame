This is a basic trivia game created to display proficiency in dynamic DOM manipulation, setTimeout functions and simple game logic. 


The player has one minute to answer the questions and submit. If the user fails to submit the quiz in the time allotted, the quiz will submit automatically and score based upon the answers that have been given at that point in time.
